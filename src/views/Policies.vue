      <policy-box title="Objectives">
        At the end of this course, students will be able to:
        <ol>

          <li>
            Understand abstract models for computing machines
            including finite automata, push-down automata, and Turing machines.
          </li>

          <li>
            Understand common notations for defining languages
            such as regular expressions and grammars.
          </li>

          <li>
            Understand what kinds of problems are computable
            and what kinds are not computable.
          </li>

          <li>
            Understand what kinds of problems are easy to compute
            and what kinds are hard to compute.
          </li>

          <li>
            Think and reason carefully about computation.
            Write about computation clearly and precisely.
            Use rigorous methods, representations,
            and proof techniques.
          </li>

          <li>
            Apply theoretical concepts to practical problems
            such as using grammars for parsing programming languages
            and using finite automata and regular expressions
            for string searching and pattern matching.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </policy-box>

      <policy-box title="Reading">
        <p>
          The textbook for the course is
          <i>Introduction to the Theory of Computation</i>
          by Michael Sipser. (ISBN: 978-1-133-18779-0)
          We will cover much of the text following the provided schedule.
          Please read the material for a given day prior to that day's lecture.
        </p>
      </policy-box>

      <policy-box title="Exams">
        <p>
          Exams consist of a Midterm and a comprehensive Final.
        </p>

        <p>
          The midterm exam will be available
          for one or more normal testing days
          as well as one or more make-up days.
          You should plan to take the exam on one of the normal testing days.
        </p>

        <p>
          The make-up days are reserved for situations such as
          unexpected circumstances,
          UAC accommodations,
          those who forget to take the test,
          or misunderstand the testing schedule.
        </p>

        <p>
          Points will be deducted from your test score
          if you take the exam on a make-up day.
          The point deduction for taking the exam
          on a make-up day is calculated based on
          five points per day.
          The deduction for the first day is five points,
          the second day is ten points, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
          You must take the exam on either a normal day
          or a make-up day, no exceptions.
          After the end of the make-up days,
          the exam is no longer available.
          You need to plan take the exam on a normal testing day
          so that if an unexpected circumstance arises
          or you forget the test or misunderstand the schedule,
          you will be able to complete the exam on a make-up day.
        </p>

        <h4>
          Grade Weighting
        </h4>

        <p>
          Your total score will be calculated based on the following percentages:
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>Midterm Exam</td>

      <policy-box title="Cheating">
        <p>
          All work you submit for this course must be your own individual work.
          Do not submit work copied from someone else even if you modify it.
          Do not allow others to copy your work.
          If you are caught violating this policy
          your grade for the course will be an E and
          you will be reported to the honor code office.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following are specific examples of violations of this policy
          (note that this list is not exhaustive):
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Copying homework or exam answers from another student,
            from the internet, from an answer key,
            or from a solutions manual.
          </li>

          <li>
            Allowing someone to copy from your homework or exam answers.
          </li>

          <li>
            Copying solutions or parts of solutions from group-work notes or
            TA-consultation notes.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </policy-box>

      <policy-box title="Honor Code Standards">
        <p>
          In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected
          to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most
          fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your
          own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result
          in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the
          university.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards.
          Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an
          effective learning and working environment. It is the university's
          expectation, and my own expectation in class, that each student will abide
          by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847
          if you have questions about those standards.
        </p>

      <policy-box title="Preventing Sexual Misconduct">
        <p>
          As required by Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the
          university prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in its
          education programs or activities. Title IX also prohibits sexual
          harassment including sexual violence committed by or against
          students, university employees, and visitors to campus. As outlined in
          university policy, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic
          violence, sexual assault, and stalking are considered forms of "Sexual
          Misconduct" prohibited by the university.
        </p>

        <p>
          University policy requires any university employee in a teaching,
          managerial, or supervisory role to report incidents of Sexual
          Misconduct that come to their attention through various forms
          including face-to-face conversation, a written class assignment or
          paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. If you
          encounter Sexual Misconduct, please contact the Title IX Coordinator
          at t9coordinator@byu.edu or 801-422-2130 or Ethics Point at
          https://titleix.byu.edu/report-concern or 1-888-238-1062
          (24-hours). Additional information about Title IX and resources
          available to you can be found at titleix.byu.edu.
        </p>

      <policy-box title="Disabilities">
        <p>
          BYU is committed to providing reasonable accommodation to qualified
          persons with disabilities. If you have any disability that may
          adversely affect your success in this course, please contact the
          University Accessibility Center at 422-2767. Services deemed
          appropriate will be coordinated with the student and instructor by
          that office.
